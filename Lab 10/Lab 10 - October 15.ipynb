    "\n",
    "### What is the Therapeutic Touch\n",
    "\n",
    "The Therapeutic Touch (TT) is the idea that everyone can feel the Human Energy Field (HEF) around individuals.  Those who practice TT have described different people's HEFs as \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "TT was a popular technique used throughout the 20th century that was toted as a great way to bring balance to a person's health. Certain practitioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals.\n",

    "### Emily Rosa\n",
    "\n",
    "[Emily Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Rosa) was a 4th grade student who was very familiar with the world of TT, thanks to her parents, who were both medical practitioners and skeptics of TT.\n",

    "### Emily's Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's experiment was clean, simple, and effective. Due to her parents' occupations in the medical field, she had wide access to people who claimed to be TT practitioners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practicioners' guesses were random, like the flip of a coin. In most medical experiments, this is the norm. We want to test whether or not the treatment has an effect, *not* whether or not the treatment actually works. \n",

Here, since larger values of the test statistic suggest the alternative model (where the chance of guessing the correct hand is something other than 50%), we can formalize our analysis by finding what proportion of simulated statistics were as large or larger than our observed test statistic (the area at or to the right of the observed test statistic). If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model."

Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!\n",

    "1) Yes, the  data is consistent with Emily's model which means that the practitioners were randomly guessing. This comes from the proportion 0.162 being more than the accepted 0.05  proportion in the histogram when we calculate the area towards the right of previously obsereved correctness of the TT professional.\n",

    "2) TT Practitioners will always try to prove their practise valid but that is lead by their self interest, however Emily's experiment is driven with data and she has tried to reduce her personal bias with randomizing the hand she gives by flipping a coin for it. Therfore, I think Emily's experiment holds a better significance than the answers by practitioners."
